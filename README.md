### Scenario based Questions of core java
   * Movie Ticket Booking App( Ask users for movie type, seat type(gold/silver) and snacks use switch and if together and loop through multiple users)
   * Library Fine calculator APP( Input return date and due date and if return late calculate fine 5 rupees per day and repeat for 5 books using for loop)
   * Bus Route Distance Tracke( Each stop add distance , Ask if the passenger wants to get off at a stop. and Use a while-loop with a total distance tracker and Exit on user confirmation.)
